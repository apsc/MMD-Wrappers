There are lots of different problems that could be causing the noise and many of them are simple to fix on your own.Before starting, make sure you have a few simple tools at the ready to make sure the job goes smoothly.A standard screwdriverA small pair of pliers.

Wow, this is a really great guide. I remember the days when I had a desktop computer and the fan would heave and sigh like a dying creature. I think the problem was dust accumulation, because whenever I opened the darned thing up, a giant cat-sized ball of skin cells and fur would come out.

Ha! I'm sure yours were better than some of the ones I worked on for friends in the past. It was like a cheeto dust graveyard.

Great hub although I think I will just call our computer expert if ours starts making wierd noises. In our case besides dust we definitely have animal fur! If the wierd noises include meowing or barking, I'll KNOW that we are in trouble! :-) Congratulations on your win!

I wouldn't dare to approach my computer with a screwdriver, but thanks for the advice. Maybe I will give it to the techie I hire.

comment - 22 by infonolan
I have a macbook and have yet to experience problems with the fan; though I try not to do too much at once and that seems to keep the fan speed down, which should help preserve it :)

Your step by step instructions are so helpful. You should be teaching a course! Most of us are afraid to open our computers, but I am slowly learning thanks to my computer friend!

comment - 38 by Psycho Gamer
I have a similar problem but not with the cpu fan but with the bios fan ( i think) , it is a tiny fan on the motherboard....For a month or even more than that, it was whining like a little kid...it almost drove me crazy...literally...until finally i decided to fix it...it took me 2 hours but i did it...
